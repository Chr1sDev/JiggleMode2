# Jiggle Mode 2.0

Jiggles homescreen icons

This is a rewrite of the first tweak I ever made. It's been a little over a year since I started learning Objective-C and tweak development. The original tweak made the homescreen app icons icons jiggle by permanently putting them in editing mode. Now that I actually have some sort of idea of what I'm doing I found the animation methods and added them to the icons to make them animate. This works much better, doesn't put the icons in a permanent state of editing and doesn't make it a pain to use.
